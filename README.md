# Bitcoin Wallet Software Comparison #

A simple comparison table made especially for Bitcoin beginners, available for your viewing pleasure here: <http://gurnec.github.io/btc-wallet-comparison>.

## Data Files ##

The table is generated from two data files:

 * [columns.yml](_data/columns.yml) specifies the table's column properties (e.g. their names which become the first row of the table, css styles to use for the elements in the column based on their values, and column tooltips).
 * [wallets.yml](_data/wallets.yml) specifies the properties of the individual table elements (e.g. their value, relative sort order, and tooltips).
